# Master Thesis Project: Optical_Flow Determination using Integrate & Fire Neurons
Project Details: investigating on using the SynSense's [speck2e](https://www.synsense.ai/products/speck-2/) neuromorphic device for optical flow determination.
This repository contains the preliminary testing of the speck2e. To get familiar with Samna and Sinabs (libraries developed by SynSense), the speck is tested on the Neuromorphic MNIST dataset (N-MNIST). In addition, other scripts are included to read the membrane potential of the neurons and its decay and observe the output spikes from the device.
