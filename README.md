# speck
Master Thesis Project: investigating on using the SynSense speck2e for optical flow determination.
This repository contains the preliminary testing of the speck2e. To get familiar with Samna and Sinabs (libraries developed by SynSense), the speck is tested on the Neuromorphic MNIST dataset (N-MNIST).
