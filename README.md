# Master Thesis Project: Optical Flow Determination using Integrate & Fire Neurons

**Project Details**: investigating on using the SynSense's [speck2e](https://www.synsense.ai/products/speck-2/) neuromorphic device for optical flow determination.

This repository contains part of my master thesis project, specifically, the preliminary testing of the speck2e. To get familiar with Samna and Sinabs (libraries developed by SynSense), the speck is tested on the Neuromorphic MNIST dataset (N-MNIST). Other scripts are included to read the membrane potential of the neurons and its decay, visualize the output of the event-based camera and observe the output spikes from the device. 

In addition, tThe repository includes some other tools developed to work with event based h5 datasets and generate videos.
